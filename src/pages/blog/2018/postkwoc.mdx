## End-term Report, KWoC

### [Introduction](#intro)

Kharagpur Winter of Code is a 5-week long online programme for the students
of various colleges, who are new to open source software development. The
programme helps students to get involved in open source and prepares them
for many open source summer programmes like Google Summer of Code.

Hi, Myself [Sangam Kumar](https://www.sangam.dev). My GitHub ID is
[sangamcse](https://github.com/sangamcse). I came to know about the programme
in an Open Source Workshop during Abhiyantran, NIT Sikkim 2017. I registered
for it on 20th Nov 2017 and started choosing a project. My semester exam ended
on 22nd Nov 2017 so I was free to start coding.

### Choosing a Project

After registration, next step was to find a suitable project from the
[listed projects](http://kwoc.kossiitkgp.in/projects).

I found [Coala](https://github.com/coala/) very interesting for me. It provides
a unified interface for linting and fixing code with a single configuration
file, regardless of the programming languages used. I joined the gitter
communication channel of coala and read the newcomer guidelines. My mentor for
this project is [Yash Nisar](https://github.com/yash-nisar). I contacted him
personally via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yash.nisar/). He guided me
to take all the steps to start. I started contributing after all the steps
done.

### Commiting on Github

#### _[My First PR](#firstpr)_

To start contribution on Coala, there were some rules to follow. It was all
given in the newcomer guidelines. Next step was to find a
[difficulty/newcomer issue](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adifficulty%2Fnewcomer).
I chose an [issue](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2004) which was
opened by my mentor. The issue was very easy for me. I solved the issue and
sent [the PR](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2148). But let me tell
you that getting merged the PR was not so easy.

Changes required in the issue was not this much. So
[Yash Nisar](https://github.com/yash-nisar 'Yash Nisar') told me to make some
more changes in another file. So my final change looks like this.

And there was some more issue in the PR. There was a failing test case on
circleCI but it was something related to an inability to fetch some dependency.
The gitmate-bot was checking the commit and my commit was not proper, so
[Yash Nisar](https://github.com/yash-nisar 'Yash Nisar') helped me in that.

![Suggestion by mentor](/images/blog/3.png)

I made some changes in my commit which now look like below.

And it passed all test cases for my first PR. It was ready to merge but
maintainer was taking some time to merge it. So the mentor suggested to
rebase my branch.

On 24th Dec, finally, my first PR got merged into the master branch of
coala/coala-bear.

#### _[My Second PR](#secondpr)_

Before choosing my second issue, I reviewed 2/3 difficulty/newcomer PRs. I was
continuous active on gitter channel of coala. Then I searched for a
[difficulty/low issue](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adifficulty%2Flow).

However, I chose a needs-design [issue](https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues/250).
This issue requires changes in the [coala.io/#/languages](https://coala.io/#/languages)
page where in place of programming language's name, there should be programming
language's logo.

I have sent a [PR](https://github.com/coala/coalaCSS/pull/29) which is some
changes in CSS.

![Changes in Second PR](/images/blog/7.png)

This PR still needs approval. I am working on a script to fetch the logo
from wikidata and add that logo to the issue. [@jayvdb](https://github.com/jayvdb),
who is one of the owners of coala, is helping me in that script. That script
needs [pywikidata API](https://pywikidata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter2.html#fetching-items).

### Post KWoC

- KWoC is ending now but since it’s an open source project, I could contribute to
  it anytime. I’ve planned to fix the issues on coala issue's list.

- I've planned to contribute to some other open-source, too.

Finally, I would like to thanks my mentor [Yash Nisar](https://github.com/yash-nisar)
for helping me. I hope he will be there when I need his mentorship.
A Lot more to learn from you. Thanks again!🙂 Also, thank you
[Kharagpur Open Source Society(KOSS)](https://kossiitkgp.in/) and the people
at KOSS for organizing Kharagpur Winter of Code and making sure that every
student who is new to the open source get benefited.
